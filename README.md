Refactor Code Homework

## Assigment 

Refactor existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet the acceptance criteria below. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Summary Of Changes

**index.html**
- Updated title to be descriptive
- Updated with semantic tags including header, nav, main, aside and footer
- Added id=“search-engine-optimization” so linking would function
- Added image alt text of alt=“” due to image only being for decoration
- Removed / from end of image tags and closing /img tag as they are unnecessary

**style.css**
- Set body width to 100%
- Consolidated redundant css elements
- Notes have been added to what was consolidated
